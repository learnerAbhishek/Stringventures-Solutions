Section 5: Basic Coding
● Write a python script to check if the provided string is a palindrome. Catch is: system can remove
1 of the alphabet and check again, if leftover string is a palindrome, Return True if its Palindrome.
i.e., aaba (Return True as, if we remove 1st ‘a’ alphabet, leftover string becomes aba and its
palindrome.
● Implement a function that checks whether a given string with parentheses is balanced or not (i.e.,
all opened parentheses have a corresponding closing one).
